/**
 * @brief Very simple database tool
 * 
 * A *very* simple, one table database tool. Each record is having a single size that can
 * be different from each other. 
 * 
 * The tool maintains the location of each record in an array in RAM. No
 * index beyond that. When a database file is open, the tool computes the
 * location of each record. All record in file are considered valid.
 * 
 * A record can be marked as deleted using the set_deleted() method. This
 * will only mark it as deleted in memory. A new database needs to be
 * created and filled with valid records by the application to get rid of
 * marked as deleted records.
 * 
 * No memory allocation is done in the tool. This is the responsability
 * of the calling application.
 * 
 * Each record is preceeded with its size in file. Nothing else is kept in file
 * then the data associated with the record.
 *
